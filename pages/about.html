                <p>At the end of the 2-year training, graduating students receive a PNC certificate and an Associate’s Degree diploma (for the ones who passed the state exam), recognized by the <span><a href="https://moeys.gov.kh/en" >MOEYs</a></span>. Graduates also have the possibility to carry on studying in year three at University, if they pass the state exam.</p>
                <p>We make a continuous effort to improve the quality of our training, adjust it to the needs of a fast changing market and ensure our students are as competitive as their university graduate counterparts. Therefore, PN Cambodia launched the ‘Openh’ project in October 2016, a vast program to update the curriculum of our 2-year training answering two main objectives:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To make sure our students gain the soft and hard skills necessary to not only earn a job, but also to advance in their career and be able to self-learn. To do so, we started providing more interactive activities and a student-centered approach, allowing students to take ownership in the learning process.</li>
                    <li>To improve students English skills as this is a necessary prerequisite for furthering their career.</li>
