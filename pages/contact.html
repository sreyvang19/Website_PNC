                        <p>If I think about my IT skills and self-discipline, I always remember PNC. They provided me with both technical and professional skills. Two years that I have been training there with many good trainers, they brought me to the technology world and brought me to visit different companies to see how the company works and behave. I was a student who studied web programming generation 2012 and currently, I am working in a private company with acceptable income to support my family. Not only financial support but also be a good sample for my community to bring their children to school for getting higher education so that they can make my community sustainable development.</p>

                        <p>I love to share my knowledge and experience in terms of programming and development to our young generations who struggling in financial support to further their study in the technology field.I am thrilled and no words could express how happy I am to see our students’ outcome at the end of their two years’ study at PNC. They become knowledgeable and mature people with very concrete technical and soft skills which could benefit not only to themselves but also to their family, community and society as a whole. Overall, there is a strong teamwork spirit at PN: we have a real understanding and friendly working environment and everyone has sharpened wills to help the students without conditions.</p>

                        <p>PNC has become my new home. I feel like we are just one big family. I am being taking care of by good people such as teachers and classmates. PNC has helped me realize that I can be a leader.</p>
